The first phase of the GlueX experiment was completed successfully at the end of 2019, collecting more than 121 pb$^{-1}$ of data in the coherent photon beam region. Using the calibrated data sets, a search for the hybrid meson candidate, the $Y(2175)$, in both $\phi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\phi(1020) f_0(980)$ channels is conducted. A first measurement of the cross section in photoproduction for both channels is established, and an upper limit on $Y(2175)$ production cross section is obtained for both $\phi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\phi(1020)f_0(980)$ final states.
~\par For a better estimation of the energy loss in the CDC, an optimization of the truncated mean method was conducted, and a 20$\%$ hit truncation at the high tale of the dE/dx distribution was concluded, which is now included in the GlueX reconstruction software.
~\par The next phase of the GlueX program will start soon, with an additional detector system the DIRC, for Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light detector, currently being installed and commissioned. This upgrade will improve the particle identification system (Fig.~\ref{fig.summ}), in order to cleanly select meson and baryon decay channels that include kaons in the final state. Once this detector has been installed and commissioned, we plan to collect a total of 200 days of physics analysis data at an average intensity of 5x10$^7$ tagged photons on target per second. This data sample will provide an order of magnitude statistical improvement over the initial GlueX data set and, with the developed kaon identification system, a significant increase in the potential for GlueX to make key experimental advances in our knowledge of hybrid mesons in the near future.
