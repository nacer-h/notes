\textit{Subject:} Application for postdoctoral position in experimental elementary particle physics.\\
\par Dear Dr. Richard Nisius,
%Content of the letter
~\par It is with great pleasure that I am writing to you to express my interest in applying for the postdoctoral position in experimental elementary particle physics to work together with the ATLAS Inner Detector Group at the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Physik. This project appeals to me because of my strong interest in particle physics in addition to using the knowledge I have gained through graduate research and my education in the university. I have been seeking just such an opportunity as this, it is clear to me that the the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Physik is genuinely devoted to the advancement of research and education, I will have the opportunity to work and learn from the best and the privilege to work in an international environment. I believe I can contribute to that mission through my passion for physics, my education and background would be a good match for your requirements.
~\par I mention that I am currently finishing my Ph.D project at the Goethe University of Frankfurt, where I work on Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) predictions, my goal is to search for mesons that manifest the gluon degrees of freedom with the GlueX experiment. I have a master's degree in particle physics at the Blaise Pascal University in France. During this programme, I did two internships, one was with the ATLAS team on a subject looking for a candidate to the Dark Mater in a signature called Monotop predicted by BSM theories, and a second with CALICE team on subject studying the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs to the top quark in $e^{+}e^{-}$ experiments, with a performance study of the new hadronic calorimeter proposed by the CALICE collaboration. I have worked as an Engineer Physicist specialized in Radiation Protection at the Algiers Nuclear Research Center, where I had the opportunity to teach master students about radiation protection and guide them through laboratory practical manipulations. Graduated in year 2010, from Setif University in Algeria and got a Master degree in Nuclear Physics, completed with a Master thesis at the Draria Nuclear Research Center. All these challenges have strengthened my skills in laboratory work and I have gained experience working with different research teams.
~\par I am eager to talk with you about the research project you proposed this would offer me the possibility of receiving the complete picture of this postdoctoral position. I am interested in exploring the nature of elementary particles, particularly the challenges of precision measurements of the Standard Model, like probing the properties of the heavies elementary particle, the top quark, and its implications on the new physics predictions.
% I am interested in exploring the experimental nature of elementary particles, especially hadron spectroscopy, . 
%  grand unification theories and physics beyond the standard model, such as Supersymmetry and dark matter phenomenology. After completing this PhD programme, I plan to apply for research positions in the field of Particle Physics.
~\par I thank you for the opportunity to submit this application for your consideration. Please contact me if there is anything else I need to provide. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.\\ \\ % theoretical and, especially grand unification theories and physics beyond the standard model, particularly its signatures in colliders such as Supersymmetry and dark matter candidates experiments
