\par Dear Professor G Anthony Williams,
%Content of the letter
~\par It is with great pleasure that I am writing to you to express my interest in applying for the ARC Grant-Funded Researcher - Experimental Physicist position, to work together with the physicists of the Adelaide Node of the Centre. This project appeals to me because of my strong interest in exploring the nature of elementary particles, in testing the Standard Model predictions, and particularly the challenges of searching for New Physics, with its peculiar signatures in the accelerators or direct observations in the universe such as DM candidates. Due to my experience regarding particle identification and hardware, I see also a potential to contribute to the efforts of the team addressing the needs of the experiment by developing the new software and hardware.
% ,in particular participating in the development of flavor tagging algorithms and luminosity measurements.
% in High energy colliders such as Supersymmetry and DM candidates
% particularly the challenges of High energy neutrino measurements and their unique ability to probe some of the most enigmatic processes at the core of stars and galaxies from across cosmological distances.
% As well as using the knowledge I have gained through graduate research and education. 
I have been seeking just such an opportunity as this, it is clear to me that the Adelaide Node of the Centre is genuinely devoted to the advancement of research and education, I will have the opportunity to work and learn from the best and the privilege to work in an international environment. I believe I can contribute to that mission through my passion for physics, my education and background would be a good match for your requirements.
~\par I mention that I am currently finishing my Ph.D project at the Goethe University of Frankfurt in Germany, where I work on Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) predictions, my goal is to search for mesons that manifest the gluon degrees of freedom with the GlueX experiment. I have a master's degree in particle physics at the Blaise Pascal University in France. During this program, I did two internships, one was with the ATLAS team on a subject looking for a candidate to the Dark Mater in a signature called Monotop predicted by New Physics theories, and a second internship studying the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs to the top quark for the future $e^{+}e^{-}$ experiments, with a performance study of the new hadronic calorimeter proposed by the CALICE collaboration. I have worked as an Engineer Physicist specialized in Radiation Protection at the Algiers Nuclear Research Center, where I had the opportunity to teach master students about radiation protection and guide them through laboratory practical manipulations. Graduated in year 2010, from Setif University in Algeria and got a Master degree in Nuclear Physics.
% , completed with a Master thesis at the Draria Nuclear Research Center. 
All these challenges have strengthened my skills in laboratory work and I have gained experience working with different research teams.
~\par I am eager to talk with you about the research project you proposed this would offer me the possibility of receiving the complete picture of this postdoctoral position. I thank you for the opportunity to submit this application for your consideration. Please contact me if there is anything else I need to provide. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.\\\\
% I am interested in exploring the experimental nature of elementary particles, especially hadron spectroscopy, . 
% grand unification theories and physics beyond the standard model, such as Supersymmetry and dark matter phenomenology. After completing this PhD programme, I plan to apply for research positions in the field of Particle Physics.
% My recommendation letters will be sent soon in a separate email
% theoretical and, especially grand unification theories and physics beyond the standard model, particularly its signatures in colliders such as Supersymmetry and dark matter candidates experiments
%Please find enclosed my CV. \\ \\
